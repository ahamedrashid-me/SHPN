**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2023-10-27  
**Project Repository:** `github.com/ahamedrashid-me/Shadow-path/`

## **1. Acceptance of Terms**

By downloading, installing, operating, or utilizing the Shadow-Path Network software (the "Software"), you ("the Operator") expressly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to these terms, you are prohibited from using the Software.

## **2. Nature of the Software**

The Shadow-Path Network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer protocol and software suite designed for private, censorship-resistant communication and data storage.

*   **Decentralized Storage:** The Software may automatically store encrypted data chunks from the network on your device in a designated "Black Box" directory. You allocate the disk space for this purpose.
*   **Anonymized Routing:** Your device may relay encrypted network traffic for other users.
*   **Zero Knowledge:** The data chunks stored on your device are encrypted. **You cannot view, select, or delete specific content.** The Software manages this storage automatically.

## **3. Operator Acknowledgment of Risk**

You expressly acknowledge and agree that:

1.  **Oblivious Operator:** You operate the node without knowledge of the specific content it stores or relays. The encrypted data chunks are indistinguishable from random data.
2.  **Plausible Deniability is Core:** The cryptographic design of the Software is intended to provide operators with plausible deniability regarding the nature of the content on their device.
3.  **No Warranty of Content:** The Shadow-Path development team, contributors, and community **do not endorse, monitor, or control** the content distributed across the network. The network may be used to share content that is illegal in some jurisdictions.
4.  **Assumption of Legal Risk:** You alone are responsible for understanding the laws in your country and jurisdiction pertaining to the operation of data storage and relay services. You assume all legal risk associated with operating the Software. Operation of this Software may not provide a complete legal defense in all jurisdictions.

## **4. Disclaimer of Warranty & Limitation of Liability**

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

## **5. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the authors, contributors, and any affiliated individuals or entities from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to your operation of the Software.

## **6. Legal Advice**

**THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** The authors are software developers, not lawyers. The information provided herein is for educational purposes only. You are strongly encouraged to consult with a qualified legal professional in your jurisdiction before operating this Software to understand your potential liability and rights.

## **7. License to Operate**

Your use of the Software is governed by the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3). This Agreement is supplemental to that license and governs the legal relationship and risks of operation.

## **8. Contact for Legal Inquiries**

**Important Notice for Law Enforcement and Third Parties:**

The Shadow-Path Network is a decentralized project. There is no central authority, company, or entity that can control, remove, or provide information about content on the network.

Operators of nodes are technologically prevented from accessing the encrypted data chunks stored on their devices. Any legal inquiries or requests for data must be directed to the individual node operator, who may be able to provide the following:
*   A copy of this Agreement.
*   Technical explanation of the Software's operation.
*   The encrypted, indistinguishable data chunks stored on the device.

**Project Contact (For Technical Inquiries Only):**  
*Please open an issue on the GitHub repository for technical support. The developers cannot respond to legal demands.*

**By proceeding to use the Shadow-Path Network Software, you signal your acceptance of these terms.**
